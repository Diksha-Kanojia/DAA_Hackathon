# Gamez - DAA Hackathon Project

Welcome to Gamez! This project is a compilation of four classic games - Cowboy, Tetris, Pong, and Snake Game - created for the DAA (Data Structures and Algorithms) hackathon. The games are built using Unity and are designed to entertain users of all ages.

## Project Description

The primary aim of our project is to entertain users. We've chosen these classic games to give our generation a taste of what their parents or grandparents experienced in their childhood, but in a modernized way. The games are quick, interactive, and do not require an internet connection, allowing users to entertain themselves just like their ancestors did in earlier times. Whether you're alone or with friends, Gamez provides a fun time for everyone.
